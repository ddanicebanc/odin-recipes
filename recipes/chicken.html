    <p>Arroz caldo is a lugaw (glutinous rice dish) made with chicken and rice. It's flavored with garlic, onions,
        ginger, fish sauce, and other seasonings. </p>
    <p>Though “arroz caldo” is a Spanish name, the dish's origins are Filipino — it is an adaptation of a congee that
        was created by Chinese-Filipino immigrants. </p>

        <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>

        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the onion, garlic, and ginger until fragrant. </li>
        <li>Add the chicken and stir in the fish sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour in the broth and sweet rice, then bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Season and continue cooking until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
    </ol>
